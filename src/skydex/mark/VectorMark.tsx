/**
 * The mark: the wordmark `W.W`, alive.
 *
 * This replaces `FramePlayer.tsx`, which flipped between the 26 rasterised
 * frames in `frames.ts`. Both of those files are still in the tree and still
 * tested; nothing on the live path imports either of them.
 *
 * WHAT IS THE SAME
 * ----------------
 * The brain. `face.ts` still decides what the mark is feeling: this component
 * assembles a `FaceState` from its props and its own timers and calls
 * `resolveEye`, exactly as the original glyph-swap `Mark` did. The priority
 * ordering, the blink gap distribution, the scan flip and the satisfied hold
 * are still that file's, and this component re-implements none of them.
 * `FramePlayer` had drifted here: it had grown its own `resolveMode` restating
 * the same priority in different words, and one of the two was always going to
 * be edited without the other.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT
 * -----------------
 * The renderer has two cooperating layers. `pose.ts` deforms the two W paths
 * into expressions. `rig.ts` is a real four-part hierarchy: root, left eye,
 * right eye and mouth. Its reusable clips add floating, breathing, anticipation
 * and follow-through without baking those motions into the letter geometry.
 * This is Wonder rather than a static wordmark now, so spatial movement is part
 * of the character instead of an accidental transform scattered through JSX.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE
 * ------------
 * One `requestAnimationFrame` loop owns the whole picture, and React renders
 * once. The flags driving the face live in refs, not state, so a blink does not
 * re-render the landing page; the loop reads those refs, resolves the pose
 * through `face.ts`, notices when a resolved pose or rig clip has changed,
 * starts a tween from the exact current shape, and writes the complete rig to
 * the SVG nodes.
 *
 * Starting the tween FROM THE CURRENT INTERPOLATED POSE rather than from the
 * previous pose's resting values is what makes interruptions look right: a
 * blink cut short by the field being focused grows out of whatever half-squashed
 * shape it was in, instead of snapping shut and animating from there.
